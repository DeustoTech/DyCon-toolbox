% description: "This class is able to solve optimization problems of a function restricted to an ordinary equation.
%               This scheme is used to solve optimal control problems in which the functional derivative is calculated. 
%               <strong>OptimalControl</strong> class has methods that help us find optimal control as well as obtaining 
%               the attached problem and it's derivative form, 
%               in both Symbolic and numerical versions."
% long: This class is able to solve optimal control problems. Optimal control refers to the problem of finding a control law
%       for a given system such that a certain optimality criterion is achieved. The essential features of an optimal control problem are:
%           <ul>
%           <li> a cost functional to be minimized;</li>
%           <li> an initial/boundary value problem for a differential equation describing the motion, in order to determine the state of the system;</li>
%           <li> a control function;</li>
%           <li> eventual constraints that have to be obeyed.</li>
%           </ul>
%           The control may be freely chosen within the given constraints, while the state is uniquely determined by the differential equation and the initial conditions.
%           We have to choose the control in such a way that the cost function is minimized. This class allows treating general optimal control problems in the form
%           $$\begin{equation*}
%               \min_{u\in\mathcal{U}} J,
%           \end{equation*}$$
%            in which the objective functional $J$ is defined as
%            $$\begin{equation*}
%               J=\Psi (x(T))+\int _{0}^{T}\mathcal{L}(x(t),u(t)),dt
%           \end{equation*}$$
%           and where $x$ is the state of a dynamical system with input $u\in\mathcal{U}$, the set of admissible controls 
%           $$\begin{equation*} \dot {x}=f(x,u),\quad x(0)=x_{0},\quad
%           u(t)\in\mathcal {U},\quad t\in [0,T]. \end{equation*}$$
%           Moreover, the class permits to choose among different methods for solving the minimization problem. At the present stage, the methods available are
% $$
% \begin{itemize}
%       \item gradient method;
%       \item gradient method with adaptive descend step;
%               \item conjugate gradient method.
% \end{itemize}
