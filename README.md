# Dycon-platform
One of the main outputs of the research conducted within DyCon is the development of new computational methods and tools (algorithms, tutorials, sample codes, software and simulations) integrated into and freely downloadable from this web. They have been classified according to the corresponding DyCon’s working packages.

  - **WP1: Control of parameter dependent problems (PDC)**
  - **WP2: Long time horizon control and the turnpike property (LTHC)**
  - **WP3: Control under constraints (CC)**
  - **WP4: Inverse design and control in the presence of singularities (SINV)**
  - **WP5: Models involving memory terms and hybrid PDE+ODE systems (MHM)**
  - **WP6: From finite to infinite-dimensional models (FI)**
